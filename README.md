# ABSTRACT
Methods beyond neural scaling laws for beating power scaling laws in machine learning have
become topical for high-performance machine learning models. Nearest Prototype Classifiers (NPCs)
introduce a category of machine learning models known for their interpretability. However, the
performance of NPCs is frequently impacted by large datasets that scale to high dimensions. We
surmount the performance hurdle by employing self-supervised prototype-based learning metrics to
intelligently prune datasets of varying sizes, encompassing low and high dimensions. This process
aims to enhance the robustification and certification of NPCs within the framework of the Learning
Vector Quantization (LVQ) family of algorithms, utilizing Crammer normalization for arbitrary
semi-norms (semi-metrics). The numerical evaluation of outcomes reveals that NPCs trained with
pruned datasets demonstrate sustained or enhanced performance compared to instances where training
is conducted with full datasets. The self-supervised prototype-based metric (SSL) and the Perceptual-
SSL (P-SSL) utilized in this study remain unaffected by the intricacies of optimal hyperparameter
selection. Consequently, data pruning metrics can be seamlessly integrated with triplet loss training
to assess the empirical and guaranteed robustness of Lp -NPCs and Perceptual-NPCs (P-NPCs),
facilitating the curation of datasets that contribute to research in applied machine learning.



The implementation requires Python >=3.11 . The author recommends to use a virtual environment or Docker image.
The details of the implementation and results evaluation can be found in the paper.
